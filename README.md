Target is to recognize the handwritten digits from the dataset

# DATASET DESCRIPTION
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), along with their corresponding labels. The dataset was created for training and testing various machine learning models, particularly for digit recognition tasks.

* Here are key characteristics of the MNIST dataset:
* Image Size:
Each image in the dataset is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, resulting in a total of 784 pixels. Each pixel has a grayscale value ranging from 0 to 255.

* Number of Classes:
There are 10 classes in the dataset, corresponding to the digits 0 through 9.

* Training and Test Sets:
The dataset is typically divided into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train machine learning models, while the test set is used to evaluate their performance on unseen data.

* Number of Samples:
The original MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is associated with a label indicating the digit it represents.

* Task:
The main task associated with the MNIST dataset is digit recognition. Given an image, the goal is to correctly classify it into one of the 10 digit classes.

* Complexity:
While MNIST is considered a relatively simple dataset compared to more modern datasets, it has served as a benchmark for testing and developing various machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Achieving high accuracy on MNIST is a fundamental step for researchers and practitioners in the field.

* Usage:
MNIST has been widely used for educational purposes, benchmarking algorithms, and exploring the capabilities of different machine learning models. It is often used as a starting point for individuals learning about image classification and deep learning.

# CONCLUSION:
CNN
The model gives highest accuracy score of 98%. Overall, considering the balance between model complexity and performance, we conclude that CNN is the best working model for this specific task."
KNN & SVM
Both gives the almost same accuracy score of 97%.
